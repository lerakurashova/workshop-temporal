      "7:24 god it was\n",
      "7:27 craft your own booket online. So it was\n",
      "7:30 drag uh and drop of the flowers and I\n",
      "7:33 was so amazed by that time when I done\n",
      "7:35 this run like I was 13 14 maybe and I\n",
      "7:41 was amazed by this project. I thought\n",
      "7:42 that I was a genius you know and my\n",
      "7:45 whole career should go towards\n",
      "7:47 programming\n",
      "7:49 and yeah I remember how proud I was and\n",
      "7:52 I found this project several years ago\n",
      "7:55 and I looked into it. It's completely\n",
      "7:57 terrible, but that's how we all start.\n",
      "8:00 >> Mhm.\n",
      "8:01 >> So, you did school. It's amazing.\n",
      "8:04 >> Yeah. Yeah. I mean, we had a lot of nice\n",
      "8:08 uh teachers back then\n",
      "8:10 >> and I am that kind of the student who\n",
      "8:15 like to skip the lessons to go to some\n",
      "8:18 kind of Olympiads. So I was skipping a\n",
      "8:21 lot of the general lessons to go to some\n",
      "8:24 kind of I don't know English language\n",
      "8:26 olympiads, literature olympiads, math\n",
      "8:29 olympiates in I mean everything that was\n",
      "8:32 available. I was going there just\n",
      "8:34 because I could skip one lesson uh with\n",
      "8:36 a potential you know bad market in it.\n",
      "8:39 [laughter]\n",
      "8:40 And so it's really how it all started\n",
      "8:43 because I went to the math and\n",
      "8:45 informatics. It was named like this at\n",
      "8:48 the time.\n",
      "8:49 >> [gasps and sighs]\n",
      "8:49 >> And uh it was interesting for me. I did\n",
      "8:53 the school uh Olympiad. I won it in a\n",
      "8:58 school. Then they sent me to the region\n",
      "9:00 to the district.\n",
      "9:02 I went to the boot camp to prepare to\n",
      "9:05 the Olympiads. And this is apparently\n",
      "9:07 how it all started. I mean essentially\n",
      "9:10 it started with algorithmic thing a lot\n",
      "9:13 because you need to solve the\n",
      "9:14 mathematical problems. But uh at the age\n",
      "9:17 of yeah 13 14 I was more into web\n",
      "9:21 programming and doing some kind of funny\n",
      "9:23 websites and uh games.\n",
      "9:26 >> It was like you know uh sitting after\n",
      "9:29 school and instead of doing the homework\n",
      "9:32 doing some kind of yeah the small things\n",
      "9:35 and I loved it. I genuinely loved the\n",
      "9:38 programming. I loved that you could sit\n",
      "9:41 alone, get obsessed with all the small\n",
      "9:44 details, you know, build something from\n",
      "9:46 a real scratch\n",
      "9:49 and that was I would say it was amazing\n",
      "9:52 for me when I was doing it kind of\n",
      "9:54 alone. And then uh after the school and\n",
      "9:58 everything finished, I went for the\n",
      "10:00 full-time job and apparently I chose the\n",
      "10:03 coding path because I thought that\n",
      "10:06 >> So you skipped university\n",
      "10:09 >> initially. Yeah. [laughter]\n",
      "10:10 >> Okay.\n",
      "10:11 >> But then I went to it.\n",
      "10:13 >> Okay.\n",
      "10:15 So I I went to the programming and I\n",
      "10:19 worked there uh in one company but for\n",
      "10:21 quite a while and\n",
      "10:24 I mean it really take away all the spark\n",
      "10:28 in coding for me because initially I\n",
      "10:31 love to go into too much details to be\n",
      "10:34 creative you know to get obsessed over\n",
      "10:37 small things and then during the work is\n",
      "10:40 just deliver this don't overthink it\n",
      "10:42 make it just work and that's it. And\n",
      "10:47 yeah, at this point I realized that the\n",
      "10:50 coding in the company is not really my\n",
      "10:53 cup of tea and I wouldn't like to, you\n",
      "10:56 know, spend like my full working days.\n",
      "10:59 So without being creative in my favorite\n",
      "11:02 hobby. So and\n",
      "11:05 >> yeah, when hobby becomes a job, it's um\n",
      "11:08 not always amazing, right?\n",
      "11:10 >> Yeah, that completely changes\n",
      "11:12 everything.\n",
      "11:13 Yeah, I remember it's so my first job. I\n",
      "11:15 had very similar experience. Um, so uh\n",
      "11:19 at school I wasn't doing like um things\n",
      "11:22 you were doing but at university I was\n",
      "11:24 taking part in many competitions like\n",
      "11:26 coding competitions.\n",
      "11:28 uh we were uh presenting our papers, our\n",
      "11:32 projects on different uh um like I don't\n",
      "11:35 know meetups or whatever like it was so\n",
      "11:38 cool but then my first work was a Java\n",
      "11:41 developer and I had to fix bugs and\n",
      "11:43 these bugs like it was written uh the\n",
      "11:45 the app was written by some genius\n",
      "11:47 person overnight who left the company\n",
      "11:49 and left like a huge pile of mess right\n",
      "11:54 and I had to figure out like how how\n",
      "11:56 this thing works. and how to fix bugs\n",
      "11:59 there. And it was so draining. It was so\n",

      "17:33 you um usually people study something\n",
      "17:35 not related and then they switch to it\n",
      "17:38 right and then uh they kind of went\n",
      "17:41 through the same journey except they\n",
      "17:42 skip like I know this five years of\n",
      "17:44 university.\n",
      "17:46 So which is um for me it's a good story\n",
      "17:48 like for me during university time so I\n",

      "18:42 instead they did four months of a boot\n",
      "18:45 camp which is an interesting career\n",

      "18:50 your LinkedIn later you did uh attend\n",
      "18:53 university right? Uh so I guess um in\n",
      "18:58 your case maybe you can correct me but\n",
      "19:01 then I remember myself when I was 17\n",
      "19:05 years old when I was gradating from the\n",
      "19:07 school like I didn't really know what\n",
      "19:10 I'm what I was going to do with my life\n",
      "19:12 right so I thought okay like I like\n",
      "19:14 programming it seems but I also like\n",

      "19:34 don't really know what you want and then\n",
      "19:36 you try different things and then you\n",
      "19:38 get this work experience and then you\n",
      "19:40 understand, okay, this is what I\n",
      "19:41 actually want to study, right? Was it\n",
      "19:43 your uh journey or\n",
      "19:45 >> I would say not exactly because uh if\n",
      "19:49 I'd want to study the product management\n",
      "19:53 apparently I wouldn't the computer\n",

      "19:59 like are there\n",
      "20:01 >> I mean\n",
      "20:02 administration\n",
      "20:05 yeah this is appropriate this is counted\n",
      "20:08 like the education you basically obtain\n",
      "20:11 to work as a product project manager\n",
      "20:14 apparently\n",
      "20:16 >> but for me it was like I have this hobby\n",
      "20:19 and I love this hobby and I want to\n",
      "20:23 learn deeper on it. So that's how I\n",
      "20:25 joined the university. It was quite\n",
      "20:27 simple for me. I was combining uh the\n",
      "20:30 job and the uni at the same time and it\n",
      "20:33 was quite a journey I would say. Yeah,\n",
      "20:36 because uh\n",
      "20:38 some of uh the university courses were\n",
      "20:42 more frustrating because you now have a\n",
      "20:44 real experience and you understand that\n",
      "20:47 it's not really working this way. But\n",
      "20:50 some of them really helped even during\n",
      "20:52 my product management career. So it just\n",
      "20:56 gave a lot of the insight of how\n",
      "20:58 everything is working around. And for me\n",
      "21:01 uh joining the university was more like\n",
      "21:04 about the academic studies especially on\n",
      "21:07 the machine learning. Uh because I\n",
      "21:11 initially thought that the entry is too\n",
      "21:15 high to go just randomly as you do with\n",
      "21:20 no web development. You just watch how\n",
      "21:23 to do the website in seven hours. You're\n",
      "21:27 kind of trying to replicate the guys\n",
      "21:29 doing around you on a YouTube channel\n",
      "21:32 and then you get something, you try to\n",
      "21:34 debug it, you read through the\n",
      "21:36 documentation, some courses, but it was\n",
      "21:39 not that widely spread at that time and\n",
      "21:42 it was just a you know simple path I\n",
      "21:45 would say for me to access all the\n",
      "21:47 information.\n",
      "21:50 >> Yeah.\n",
      "21:51 Okay. So I actually the reason we wanted\n",
      "21:54 to talk like your career journey is\n",
      "21:56 quite interesting and um not common I\n",
      "22:00 would say uh this is pretty cool but I\n",
      "22:03 also want to learn more about your\n",
      "22:05 startup. So how did you come up with\n",
      "22:08 with this idea? Uh yeah tell us.\n",
      "22:12 It was pretty I would say pretty radical\n",
      "22:15 decision uh because all my life I wanted\n",
      "22:19 a dog and I haven't adopted one because\n",
      "22:23 I mean firstly when I was a kid uh it's\n",
      "22:26 just too much of the pressure from the\n",
      "22:29 parents that oh there is no time blah\n",
      "22:32 blah blah and when you're the grownup\n",
      "22:35 you really understand the constraints\n",
      "22:37 like I was moving a lot I was working\n",
      "22:40 then I was combining the studies and\n",
      "22:42 work and everything at the same time and\n",
      "22:45 everything full-time and everything\n",
      "22:48 not remotely. So it was um like there\n",
      "22:52 was no room for the part I would love to\n",
      "22:55 have. And at one point uh when my job\n",
      "22:59 started to be more remoteish, so I could\n",
      "23:02 go to the office two three times uh per\n",
      "23:06 week and then sit at home for two three\n",
      "23:09 days uh which I adored. I thought maybe\n",
      "23:12 it's kind of time to think about it. But\n",
      "23:17 there is actually a really fun story\n",
      "23:19 because me and my husband we were\n",
      "23:21 scrolling through the website where you\n",
      "23:24 can find like uh things. It's named\n",
      "23:28 assas.com in Latvia that's apparently a\n",
      "23:32 in Russia it's basically\n",

      "23:41 everything at one place. Yeah. and he\n",
      "23:45 was joking about adopting a spider\n",
      "23:48 because I I mean I can't see the spider\n",
      "23:52 even in five meters\n",
      "23:54 around me. I would scream. I would have\n",
      "23:56 a panic. I mean I would yeah go crazy.\n",
      "24:00 He was joking about it and apparently we\n",
      "24:03 clicked into the section puppies\n",
      "24:07 and we saw that there's one puppy\n",
      "24:10 available right now. Uh so she was a\n",
      "24:13 Labrador. It was 1st of the January and\n",
      "24:17 we wrote a message to the breeder. Do\n",

      "24:32 And we asked in I don't it was like\n",
      "24:35 around 8:00 p.m. and we asked if we\n",
      "24:37 could come over and see them.\n",
      "24:41 and she replied, \"Oh, maybe tomorrow.\"\n",
      "24:44 But my husband was like super\n",
      "24:46 persistent. He was like, \"Um, maybe if\n",
      "24:49 we would come tomorrow, then we wouldn't\n",
      "24:51 adopt anyone. Can we please come today?\"\n",
      "24:54 >> Okay.\n",
      "24:55 >> And so here we are uh riding uh driving\n",
      "25:00 to the middle of nowhere because it was\n",
      "25:02 really outside of the city for us. It\n",
      "25:05 was hour and a half of drive.\n",
      "25:08 And then we met all those puppies. One\n",
      "25:11 of them were chewing my boot already.\n",
      "25:14 One of them were running, running\n",
      "25:16 around. One of them was barking on us.\n",
      "25:18 And then there was a puppy who would sit\n",
      "25:21 and look in the eyes.\n",
      "25:24 And apparently we spent like an hour\n",
      "25:27 outside minus 15, I don't know,\n",
      "25:30 something like this. We were freezing\n",
      "25:33 and we took the dog home. [laughter]\n",

      "25:37 So\n",
      "25:38 >> was looking at you, right?\n",
      "25:40 >> Yeah, she chose me. I I thought that she\n",
      "25:43 chose me and I still think this way.\n",
      "25:46 >> So we took her home. But you know as uh\n",
      "25:52 the same with the parenting because we\n",
      "25:54 shifted our routine so much. It's so\n",
      "25:57 much different. The puppy needs so much\n",
      "25:59 attention. They are not joking about it\n",
      "26:01 on the internet. It completely shifts\n",
      "26:04 your day.\n",
      "26:05 >> Yeah. when my son if my son asks me for\n",

      "26:13 >> it's like two months of sleepless nights\n",
      "26:16 of the proper sleepless nights because\n",
      "26:19 the puppy is in stress she's crying\n",
      "26:22 around she needs to go outside a lot\n",
      "26:26 >> because she can't uh contain herself so\n",
      "26:30 that's definitely a journey but the sad\n",
      "26:32 thing that we encountered is that the\n",
      "26:34 breeder was not really honest with us.\n",
      "26:37 Uh so\n",
      "26:39 she was like a bread dog. She had a\n",
      "26:42 passport. She had all the documents. But\n",
      "26:44 apparently we haven't researched enough\n",
      "26:48 uh what needs to be done, what needs to\n",
      "26:50 be tested in dogs to ensure that they're\n",
      "26:51 like super healthy.\n",
      "26:54 and she didn't show us one particular\n",
      "26:57 test uh to the hypercurattosis\n",
      "27:01 which we found out later on and it's uh\n",
      "27:07 a kind of disease uh it's allergy\n",
      "27:10 apparently that's inherited from the\n",
      "27:11 parents and it would show off in the\n",

      "27:23 because and super anxious parent\n",
      "27:26 [laughter]\n",
      "27:28 and I was, you know, having a lot of the\n",
      "27:31 guilt that I didn't notice it on time\n",
      "27:33 that we don't know what's the allergy.\n",
      "27:36 We're going to vets like two, three\n",
      "27:38 times a month, but we still don't know\n",
      "27:40 what is it, what is the trigger, how we\n",
      "27:43 can cure it. And I'm really taxi person,\n",
      "27:46 so I wear like aura ring, the the Apple\n",

      "27:58 everything. And at one point I thought,\n",
      "28:01 why don't I have anything for my dog and\n",
      "28:04 I started to research. Uh there were\n",
      "28:08 plenty of the devices available. We\n",
      "28:10 bought one device that we liked more. It\n",
      "28:13 was nice. It showed us the step\n",
      "28:16 statistics\n",
      "28:17 uh like the calories and we thought it's\n",
      "28:20 interesting but it does not really solve\n",
      "28:23 our case. Then we went for the second,\n",
      "28:25 for the third, for the fourth. She ended\n",
      "28:27 up like a Christmas tree with all the\n",
      "28:29 trackers on her neck. None of them\n",
      "28:32 worked and at that time we thought that\n",
      "28:35 maybe it's worth building it ourselves.\n",
      "28:38 So that's how the journey apparently\n",
      "28:40 started. Mhm. Okay. That's that's really\n",
      "28:44 interesting. Uh so what exactly was\n",
      "28:47 missing like what kind of data you\n",
      "28:49 didn't have in this in the existing\n",
      "28:51 devices that you needed?\n",
      "28:54 >> So it's basically um from now on\n",

      "32:23 do this because they are so scared of\n",

      "32:33 they don't really seem to care about\n",

      "32:50 different races uh breeds, right? They\n",
      "32:53 um probably have some inherent diseases,\n",

      "32:59 need to take into account.\n",
      "33:01 >> And uh the worst and the most\n",
      "33:04 interesting thing is each dog is\n",
      "33:06 different. You can take my Labrador for\n",
      "33:10 example and her sister and there are so\n",
      "33:12 much different. the one would you know\n",
      "33:14 go around 10 kilometers he hide from the\n",
      "33:18 people who is like trying to find her\n",

      "33:40 in the ducks in running And it's not\n",
      "33:43 only about the character about I mean\n",
      "33:47 the food behavior but also about the how\n",
      "33:51 much of mental stimulation they need to\n",
      "33:54 feel healthier, how much uh physical\n",
      "33:58 activities they need, how much sleep,\n",
      "34:01 what are their daily patterns. So it's\n",
      "34:04 similar to\n",
      "34:06 people in this kind of sense because we\n",
      "34:08 are all different. For example, I need\n",
      "34:11 to sleep for minimum of eight hours and\n",
      "34:14 some of my friends are okay with six\n",
      "34:16 hours and they feel just perfect. They\n",
      "34:20 can have interrupted sleep and\n",
      "34:22 everything will be fine in their side\n",
      "34:24 and for me it's just a disaster for the\n",
      "34:27 whole week. [laughter]\n",
      "34:28 >> Mhm. Okay, I can relate to that. What\n",
      "34:31 kind of data do you collect? uh like you\n",
      "34:34 mentioned movement is it like steps or\n",
      "34:36 what else you collect?\n",
      "34:39 >> So if we're talking about the thing that\n",
      "34:42 collects the data itself it's IMU\n",
      "34:44 basically uh\n",
      "34:46 >> what\n",
      "34:46 >> IMU module that collects yeah the\n",
      "34:50 gyroscope axil road and magnetometer\n",
      "34:53 data around all axis\n",
      "34:56 >> was it English? Yeah, [laughter]\n",
      "34:59 unfortunately.\n",
      "35:03 >> But if we are talking about the activity\n",
      "35:06 and the labels of what we are collecting\n",
      "35:09 is uh firstly the time of their being\n",
      "35:13 active. So it's walking, it's playing\n",
      "35:16 with someone, it's running around, then\n",
      "35:21 it's of course the sleeping patterns\n",
      "35:23 with this is complicated. Can I\n",
      "35:26 interrupt you for a second? So you have\n",
      "35:28 a collar, right?\n",
      "35:29 >> So a collar and then you place it here,\n",
      "35:31 right? So the device\n",
      "35:33 >> and then it I assume that what you can\n",
      "35:37 at each time um you track the position\n",
      "35:40 of this thing. So you can see if the dog\n",
      "35:42 is moving with what speed uh you have\n",
      "35:45 all these deltas in the 3D space, right?\n",
      "35:50 And from this you can understand I guess\n",
      "35:52 this is the same what my watch is doing\n",
      "35:54 when it tracks my uh steps and other\n",
      "35:57 things. So it can understand if I'm I\n",
      "36:00 don't know walking somewhere if I'm\n",
      "36:01 running if I'm doing something else.\n",
      "36:03 >> So you can do the same but with dogs\n",
      "36:05 right? So you can understand if this is\n",
      "36:07 uh if the dog is sleeping, if the dog is\n",
      "36:09 moving, if the dog is playing other\n",
      "36:11 things. So this is just by looking at\n",
      "36:16 differences between uh the positions in\n",
      "36:18 3D space. Right.\n",
      "36:20 more or less. Yeah. [laughter]\n",
      "36:21 >> Okay.\n",
      "36:22 >> So, it's uh you're having the basically\n",
      "36:26 the location of the device. It's not the\n",
      "36:29 3D space. It's 27D. [laughter]\n",
      "36:32 >> Okay. But still uh yeah more or less\n",
      "36:35 you're looking towards the concrete\n",
      "36:37 location point in the space and then by\n",
      "36:41 the different patterns you analyze what\n",
      "36:43 the dog is apparently doing what are the\n",
      "36:46 behaviors and what is happening around.\n",
      "36:51 >> Mhm. Okay. So that is the first thing\n",
      "36:54 but then I interrupted you before you\n",
      "36:55 started moving to was it sleeping or\n",
      "36:59 >> Yeah. Then there is a sleeping part\n",
      "37:02 which fascinates me a lot because I'm a\n",
      "37:05 fan of sleep apparently.\n",
      "37:06 >> Yeah.\n",
      "37:08 >> So, and uh we track the cycle of the\n",
      "37:12 sleep. So, for the dogs, it's really um\n",
      "37:17 important to have both night and day\n",
      "37:20 sleep. And it's so much different in how\n",
      "37:23 it's perceived towards their energy. So\n",
      "37:27 we track how much do they sleep firstly\n",
      "37:31 how their sleep looks like. So is it are\n",
      "37:35 they moving a lot during the sleep. So\n",
      "37:38 that's again the same device, right? You\n",
      "37:40 don't track heart rate here. You only\n",
      "37:42 see you only look at movement, right?\n",
      "37:44 And if the dog is at one position and\n",
      "37:47 not moving like maybe it's a deep phase\n",
      "37:49 of the sleep, right?\n",
      "37:51 >> Things like that.\n",
      "37:52 >> I mean more like this. Yeah, I would\n",
      "37:54 love we're still exploring with heart\n",
      "37:57 variability because I mean for people\n",
      "38:00 it's quite simple. You're having I mean\n",
      "38:03 the sensor right here and it flashes\n",
      "38:06 green. So I guess with Garmin it's the\n",
      "38:09 same and it's the optical sensor that\n",
      "38:11 gives the availability of such rich data\n",
      "38:17 as the heart rate but in dogs uh they're\n",
      "38:21 really furry creatures.\n",
      "38:24 Some of them are like stamoas. I'm not\n",
      "38:28 sure if you're aware of the breed, but\n",
      "38:30 they look like a giant snowballs\n",
      "38:32 apparently. And we can't really ask\n",
      "38:35 owners to shave the mac.\n",
      "38:38 >> Yes. [laughter]\n",
      "38:39 >> So uh for that our new device uh we is\n",
      "38:44 really really sensitive to everything\n",
      "38:48 that is going around. Uh with the\n",
      "38:50 breathing patterns, it's easier to\n",
      "38:53 recognize them. We're still working\n",
      "38:56 towards it. But it's easier because you\n",
      "38:59 can track the subtle location changes\n",
      "39:02 when the dog breathes.\n",
      "39:04 >> But with the heart, it's really\n",
      "39:08 difficult to understand where is the\n",
      "39:12 noise and where is the heart. So it's a\n",
      "39:15 lot of work towards this field. I also\n",
      "39:17 know for runners you can have like I\n",
      "39:19 think on your you put it on your arm\n",
      "39:21 here or on chest right and then uh they\n",
      "39:24 don't use the same uh technology as you\n",
      "39:27 described like it's not optical uh they\n",
      "39:30 probably um\n",
      "39:33 >> how to say they hear the bit perhaps I\n",
      "39:36 don't know I'm just making assumptions\n",
      "39:38 and based on that because I don't see uh\n",
      "39:41 cameras there I don't see these optical\n",
      "39:42 sensors and they are not blinking\n",
      "39:45 >> um so that I I use a chest strap. Um, so\n",
      "39:49 probably it can hear my heartbeat. Like\n",
      "39:51 is it also possible to use something\n",
      "39:53 like that for dogs or because of the fur\n",
      "39:56 it's very hard to you know um hear\n",
      "40:00 through this.\n",
      "40:03 Uh so that's a really hard question for\n",
      "40:07 us to solve but yeah you are absolutely\n",
      "40:09 right because I mean you're having I\n",
      "40:12 suppose I'm not sure about what device\n",
      "40:14 are you talking but I suppose you're\n",
      "40:15 having the same technology of MU\n",
      "40:18 integrated in the device that reads your\n",
      "40:21 movement and can hear the heart beating\n",
      "40:24 >> and yeah it's just a really sensitive uh\n",
      "40:27 sensor that allows you to capture these\n",
      "40:30 small movements and then understand that\n",
      "40:32 this is not the noise, this is the heart\n",
      "40:35 that is beating in your body apparently.\n",
      "40:38 But in dogs the four is a real\n",
      "40:41 complicated case and not only the four\n",
      "40:44 but the heart itself because uh\n",
      "40:48 different dogs are having the different\n",
      "40:52 patterns of the heartbeat the different\n",
      "40:54 issues problems for some of them for the\n",
      "40:58 really furry ones it's basically for now\n",
      "41:03 really complicated to understand and\n",
      "41:06 catch here the signal of the heartbeat\n",
      "41:09 but for the you know I mean doberman\n",
      "41:12 it's really easy yeah you can\n",
      "41:15 distinguish these patterns you can see\n",
      "41:17 this in the data these small movements\n",
      "41:19 [clears throat] of the sensorical\n",
      "41:21 >> uh graphs so yeah\n",
      "41:24 >> is it useful like do you actually need\n",
      "41:27 to have heart rate data\n",
      "41:30 >> actually not really I mean for us for\n",
      "41:33 the people it's perceived like a really\n",
      "41:37 essential value in that kind of health\n",
      "41:39 trackers. But for the dogs, thanks to\n",
      "41:42 all the vets, uh we're having a\n",
      "41:44 different patterns in the health\n",
      "41:48 problems identification. So why I'm\n",
      "41:51 talking that much of the sleep and\n",
      "41:52 obsessing over it because that's a\n",
      "41:55 number two metric of how to understand\n",
      "41:57 how your dog is really doing. Number one\n",
      "42:00 is the weight and it apparently is super\n",
      "42:03 visible but that does not show you the\n",
      "42:06 problem early on early enough to catch\n",
      "42:09 and prevent the really big troubles. And\n",
      "42:12 with a sleep it shows you kind of the\n",
      "42:16 pattern of the pain two three days\n",
      "42:20 before you would visually see it in\n",
      "42:22 activity.\n",

      "42:48 for them that's just a\n",

      "42:54 is doing. Are they in pain or not? Do we\n",
      "42:56 need to do this particular tests or it's\n",
      "43:00 just the owner that's worried a bit too\n",
      "43:03 much that the spark from the ice is\n",
      "43:04 gone.\n",
      "43:05 >> So you mentioned that for you it's more\n",
      "43:08 like anomaly detection. So you have a\n",
      "43:10 typical day of a dog and then a few\n",
      "43:13 typical of days of a dog. So then you\n",
      "43:15 can see okay this is a normal day and if\n",

      "43:33 time to go to a vet right is this how it\n",
      "43:35 works\n",

      "44:32 you basically need a bit of\n",
      "44:36 more time to learn what is all right for\n",
      "44:38 this dog and then uh yeah it's just the\n",
      "44:41 deviations that can help you to detect\n",
      "44:44 the anomalies but you still need to\n",
      "44:46 account for the aging uh for the changes\n",

      "44:59 let's say you probably have some data uh\n",

      "45:03 >> like is there something you can already\n",
      "45:06 look at u in the data from day one cuz\n",
      "45:09 probably there's something you learned\n",

      "45:13 dog starts wearing this thing maybe\n",
      "45:16 there's something you can already detect\n",
      "45:17 because for example when I buy a Garmin\n",

      "45:44 the breed the age and the weight so it's\n",
      "45:49 similar to people a bit different uh\n",

      "47:56 two, but more than that. And it was u it\n",

      "48:05 >> One year. Wow.\n",
      "48:06 >> Yeah.\n",

      "48:36 yeah, but as an alternative, I had only\n",
      "48:40 the option to pretend that I didn't care\n",
      "48:43 that much or it's not that important for\n",
      "48:47 me. And at some point, it just\n",
      "48:50 >> felt worse.\n",
      "48:51 >> But also like as we in our society, we\n",
      "48:56 need money to exist and the work is\n",
      "48:59 giving you that. It gives you money,\n",

      "49:04 don't know if you lived in London when\n",
      "49:05 you started your company, but I know you\n",
      "49:08 recently moved, right? So maybe you\n",
      "49:09 lived in Latia.\n",
      "49:10 >> Well, London is a very expensive city,\n",

      "49:17 just leave your job and start working on\n",
      "49:19 your project cuz you need to think,\n",
      "49:21 okay, like where tomorrow I have to pay\n",
      "49:23 for my rent, like where do I get the\n",
      "49:25 money from? Like how did you solve this\n",
      "49:28 problem? Did you find investment or are\n",
      "49:30 you bootstrapping? like how did you\n",
      "49:32 >> [snorts]\n",
      "49:32 >> um yeah like how do you live actually?\n",
      "49:37 >> It was yeah it is actually really hard\n",
      "49:40 decision. I had my savings and\n",
      "49:43 thankfully my husband supported me at\n",
      "49:46 this decision. Uh so I took the leap\n",
      "49:51 >> and decided to pursue the fit tail or\n",
      "49:54 the deep full-time.\n",
      "49:56 basically about the investment. It's my\n",
      "50:00 choice that we're not taking this in the\n",
      "50:03 beginning before we ship the product\n",
      "50:06 because for now I would waste almost a\n",
      "50:10 year approximately average to get the\n",
      "50:13 investment that would last us for 18\n",
      "50:16 months\n",
      "50:17 >> and during this year we can survive on\n",
      "50:21 bootstrapping the product and on solving\n",

      "50:28 pitching everyone, creating the pitch\n",
      "50:31 ducks and going all around the world to\n",
      "50:33 find one person to fund the idea. So,\n",
      "50:36 it's a considerate choice, but I already\n",
      "50:39 know how much money we wasted and that\n",
      "50:41 terrifies me and at the same time I\n",
      "50:44 understand that\n",
      "50:45 >> you meant spent not wasted, right?\n",
      "50:48 Yeah, for some of the cases it's wasted\n",
      "50:51 because not everything goes according to\n",
      "50:54 the plan in the beginning.\n",
      "50:55 >> We had a lot of uh troubles all with the\n",
      "50:59 hardware in the beginning. So\n",
      "51:01 >> it was wasted completely on a lot of\n",
      "51:04 prototypes but the good thing that we\n",
      "51:06 learned a lot from that. Uh so but if\n",
      "51:10 we're returning to the investors and\n",
      "51:14 investments unfortunately at some point\n",
      "51:15 we will need to have around just because\n",
      "51:19 you can't uh produce you can't uh\n",
      "51:23 manufacture all of the devices without\n",
      "51:25 getting the money first\n",
      "51:28 >> and you can't ask users to wait for half\n",
      "51:31 a year to ship these devices. I mean\n",
      "51:34 with Kickstarter it works perfectly but\n",
      "51:37 when you need to account for the higher\n",
      "51:40 budget you you need the [clears throat]\n",
      "51:42 money to produce the volume.\n",
      "51:45 >> Yeah I guess with software as service\n",
      "51:47 when you just you know create a website\n",
      "51:49 it's easier you can bootstrap but when\n",
      "51:52 we talk about physical things that you\n",
      "51:53 need to produce then you need to have\n",
      "51:55 some capital right and then it's\n",
      "51:57 difficult to get it without investors.\n",
      "52:00 What kind of prototypes? You mentioned\n",
      "52:02 you wasted air quotes uh money on\n",
      "52:05 creating prototypes. Uh what were the\n",
      "52:08 prototypes and how did you um\n",
      "52:11 come about designing them? Like is it\n",
      "52:14 cuz I know there are Arduinos but\n",
      "52:17 Arduinos are large right? You cannot\n",
      "52:18 really put it on your dock.\n",
      "52:21 >> Um like how did you create the first\n",
      "52:24 version of the device and how did you\n",
      "52:26 create this prototypes?\n",
      "52:29 So the first version was purely if we're\n",
      "52:32 talking about the sensors that was\n",
      "52:34 purely oh we got this sample from\n",
      "52:37 AliExpress and try to assemble something\n",
      "52:40 just see whether it actually catches\n",
      "52:43 anything whether we can make sense of it\n",
      "52:46 whether I can somehow you know\n",
      "52:48 understand the data and the patterns\n",
      "52:50 even from this clumsy thing and it was\n",
      "52:54 good in the beginning\n",
      "52:55 >> was not happy about that\n",
      "52:57 >> I\n",
      "52:58 We didn't ask much. [laughter]\n",
      "53:01 >> She was forced to be she was forced to\n",
      "53:03 be the tester from the day one.\n",
      "53:06 >> Try to remove it or\n",
      "53:08 >> Oh, no. No. She is completely fine with\n",
      "53:10 that. Uh so with the dogs, it's the good\n",
      "53:13 thing because they are get used to\n",
      "53:16 wearing the collar because they need to\n",
      "53:18 wear it for the walks. So and if you're\n",
      "53:21 leaving the collar and putting something\n",
      "53:23 on it, it does not distract them much.\n",
      "53:26 So initially the device was heavier. The\n",
      "53:29 prototype, the first one was heavier,\n",
      "53:31 but right now we're around 36 grams. So\n",
      "53:36 it's basically more or less nothing for\n",
      "53:39 the ordinary size dogs. So from 3 kg, uh\n",
      "53:44 it's nothing actually to them. But yeah,\n",
      "53:47 our first prototypes were like solding\n",
      "53:50 at home, doing everything ourselves,\n",
      "53:54 trying to make sense of it.\n",
      "53:56 >> What did you use? I guess it wasn't a it\n",
      "53:58 was something smaller, right?\n",
      "54:00 >> Yeah. Yeah, it's AliExpress components.\n",
      "54:04 We were deassembling a lot of the\n",
      "54:06 devices trying to find what are the\n",
      "54:08 components like for example ESP 32 ones.\n",
      "54:13 We ordered them. We took a look. We did\n",
      "54:17 a really shitty prototype for our doctor\n",
      "54:20 where it and then we understood that for\n",
      "54:23 us it would be a bit more complicated to\n",
      "54:26 build something on the\n",
      "54:30 scale, not from the AliExpress, but\n",
      "54:33 something more reliable, more sensitive\n",
      "54:35 and accounting for all of the\n",
      "54:38 complications. And we went to the one\n",
      "54:41 outsourcing company and as a lot of\n",
      "54:44 founders we faced with the problems like\n",
      "54:47 our expectations were a bit different.\n",
      "54:51 The timelines especially budgets were\n",
      "54:55 really different at the time we agreed\n",
      "54:58 on something. So it was a was a journey\n",
      "55:02 [laughter]\n",
      "55:03 not really fascinating one but everyone\n",
      "55:06 faces\n",
      "55:06 >> it is pretty fascinating. Right. So,\n",
      "55:09 what is fascinating is\n",
      "55:11 um\n",
      "55:13 everything you went through in order to\n",
      "55:15 be where you are right now. I think for\n",
      "55:17 me it's pretty fascinating cuz I'm I'm\n",
      "55:19 really interested in hearing these\n",
      "55:21 stories like yours like all the things\n",
      "55:23 you tried and still trying. This is\n",
      "55:25 really cool. So, that's great. Um you\n",
      "55:28 keep saying we. So, by we, who do you\n",
      "55:30 mean? Your husband and you or you have\n",
      "55:33 some somebody else in the team? We have\n",
      "55:35 a team of uh five. It's me, my husband\n",
      "55:40 that is advising me, helping me and then\n",
      "55:44 there is several guys, sex colleagues,\n",
      "55:49 uh everyone that I found in the meetups\n",
      "55:52 that are helping. So I can't really\n",
      "55:55 dispose the names but basically uh\n",
      "55:58 they're\n",
      "56:00 >> working then they're doing the part of\n",
      "56:03 their job like\n",
      "56:06 >> coding doing the application designing\n",
      "56:09 helping to interview people doing the\n",
      "56:12 marketing so it's uh it can be done for\n",
      "56:16 with the help of two people we needed\n",
      "56:19 the team in the beginning and I'm really\n",
      "56:21 thankful that I found the\n",
      "56:23 apparently\n",
      "56:25 uh that are really motivated to solve\n",
      "56:28 this problem and to tackle this\n",
      "56:30 challenge.\n",
      "56:31 >> How did you find them?\n",
      "56:34 >> So uh meetups most monthly. So it's\n",
      "56:38 firstly I'm a fan of uh going everywhere\n",
      "56:42 the life takes me.\n",
      "56:44 >> So if I see Yeah. Websummit was a\n",
      "56:47 perfect example of it, but there's too\n",
      "56:49 much of people to find.\n",
      "56:52 >> Yeah. A lot of traffic. Yeah.\n",
      "56:55 >> Yeah. It's it's complicated to have a\n",
      "56:58 conversation that is long enough to get\n",
      "57:02 each other.\n",
      "57:02 >> Yeah. Right. I think we only talked to\n",
      "57:04 for like five minutes\n",
      "57:07 >> maybe,\n",
      "57:07 >> if not less. like we started talking and\n",
      "57:09 then another guy appeared and then uh\n",
      "57:11 and then he noticed his friend and then\n",
      "57:13 this friend came and then uh already I\n",
      "57:16 don't know what we are talking about but\n",
      "57:19 >> and it was entire day like that.\n",
      "57:22 >> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Completely. So and I'm\n",

      "57:39 startups. So that's a that's an amazing\n",
      "57:41 thing. You're sharing the knowledge uh a\n",
      "57:45 lot you're chatting over the coffee not\n",
      "57:47 about some KPIs but about the challenges\n",
      "57:51 you are solving in your facing. So uh\n",
      "57:55 for us it was a really great decision uh\n",
      "57:59 to uh move from I mean for me just\n",
      "58:02 personally from the office to the\n",
      "58:04 co-working place because I I meet the\n",
